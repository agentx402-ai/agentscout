// The plugin's two manifests have to agree with each other, and nothing else checks that they do:
// CI validates they are well-formed JSON, never what is inside them. The sibling repo shipped a real
// bug through exactly this gap — its plugin.json collected the user's account key in a sensitive
// field while .mcp.json never passed it to the server, so the value was silently discarded.
// Both directions are failures, so both are pinned here:
//   declared but not passed  -> collected and thrown away
//   passed but not declared  -> always empty, because nothing ever populates it
