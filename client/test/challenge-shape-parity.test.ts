// Mirror of the SERVICE's 402 PAYMENT-REQUIRED challenge-shape pin. The service side keeps a
// matching test asserting exactly what its x402 verifier emits — that is the single source of
// truth for the envelope; this file is the client half. Here we pin the fields the CLIENT
// actually reads off the envelope + each `accepts` entry, and PROVE it by driving a
// service-shaped fixture through the real client consumers (`challengePriceUsd` +
// `buildPaymentHeader`). If the service ever drops or renames a field the client signs over,
// one of the two mirrored tests breaks — the cross-repo gate a single typecheck cannot provide,
// since client and service live in separate repos.
//
// CROSS-REPO CONTRACT: keep REQUIRED_ACCEPT_KEYS identical to the worker mirror. A change to the
// challenge envelope or to an accepts entry must land in BOTH repos in lockstep.
