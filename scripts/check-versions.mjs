// scripts/check-versions.mjs — the version-lockstep gate (RELEASING.md).
// Usage:
//   node scripts/check-versions.mjs           # all six sources agree with each other
//   node scripts/check-versions.mjs v0.2.3    # ...and each equals the given release tag
//
// Two automated callers, one implementation, so the two can no longer drift:
//   - ci.yml's `versions` job runs it with NO argument, on every pull request: the sources
//     must agree with each other, whatever the version happens to be.
//   - publish.yml's build job runs it WITH the resolved release tag, at the one moment a
//     mismatch becomes irreversible: a Release tagged v0.4.0 cut on a commit still carrying
//     0.3.1 would otherwise publish 0.3.1 under that Release. The VERSION constants are
//     compiled INTO the published bundles and the plugin's .mcp.json pin decides which CLI
//     actually runs for plugin users, so drift there ships packages that misreport themselves.
// The tag form is also the local pre-release check — run it by hand before cutting a release.
//
// This script has no dependencies beyond node: builtins and is never installed, so publish.yml
// can call it before `npm ci` without weakening the property that its guard runs no third-party
// code. Keep it that way.
